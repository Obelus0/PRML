# Regression
Task 1: Polynomial curve fitting for univariate dataset

Task 2: Linear model for regression using polynomial basis functions for Bivariate Dataset

Task 3: Linear model for regression using Gaussian basis functions for Bivariate & Multivariate Dataset

Implemented L2 & Tikhonov Regularisation for all.  <p> K-Fold Cross Validation to determine best model. </p>

# Report
Contains the conclusions of the performance of the models
